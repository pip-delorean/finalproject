# Nebraska 2018 FBI Crime Data Analysis
## By Chris Galusha

This project was written using the [Laravel PHP Frawework](https://laravel.com/docs) (version 8) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/).

To get this running on your machine:

Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/), PHP's package manager.

Install [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/).

Install PHP version 7.3+ and the following PHP extensions:

- BCMath PHP Extension
- Ctype PHP Extension
- Fileinfo PHP Extension
- JSON PHP Extension
- Mbstring PHP Extension
- OpenSSL PHP Extension
- PDO PHP Extension
- Tokenizer PHP Extension
- XML PHP Extension

Run the command `composer global require laravel/installer`

cd to the FinalProject directory and run `php artisan serve`

This will start a web server running at localhost:8000, which you can navigate to with a web browser.
The index page should offer navigation to all the available analyses.
